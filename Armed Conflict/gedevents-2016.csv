Lamu County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri confirmed the attack occurred at Mangai Rapid Deployment Unit Camp where police engaged about 20 Al-Shabaab terrorists in a gunfight, injuring several others.

TD 
Security officers on the ground said one officer was injured during the raid which happened.

""Over 20 Al-Shabaab attempted to attack Administration Police camp but they were repulsed. The heavily armed gunmen hurled grenades and fired at the AP camp but our officers managed to overpower them,"" Kanyiri told Xinhua.

This is third attempt by the militants to attack the camp comprising Rapid Deployment Unit officers (RDU), a special force trained in combat operations.

Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said a major security operation was underway, with a back-up team deployed there Thursday.

It came days after a police officer was killed, another injured and a security car hit by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Ishakani area at the Kenya-Somalia border. One officer was killed and two others wounded in the Tuesday evening incident.

The police officers were on normal patrol when the vehicle runs over an IED planted by Al-Shabaab militants.

The Somali militants have intensified attacks in Lamu using IEDs. At least 50 Al-Shabaab members have been sighted in Lamu by locals in recent days.

The IED strategically planted along the roads near Kenya Somalia border are slowing down security operations to flush out militants hiding in the vast Boni forest which is near the Somali border, according to commanders involved in the operation.

The areas affected include Bondhei, Pandanguo, Kiunga, Baragoi and Milimani which has claimed several lives in the recent past.",1,Lamu town,,Lamu county,Lamu West Constituency,-2.269248,40.899148,POINT (40.899148 -2.269248),126442,Kenya,501,Africa,1,1,07/14/2016 00:00:00,07/14/2016 00:00:00,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,
